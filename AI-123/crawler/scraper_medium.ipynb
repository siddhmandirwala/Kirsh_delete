We focus on getting to know ROS2, which is what the robotics community is moving towards. Here arePart 2andPart 3of this series.If you‚Äôre new to Robot Operating System as a concept, check outthispost to read what ROS actually is.Hello there! Since you already have working knowledge of ROS1, for brevity, we‚Äôre gonna jump straight to the differences between ROS1 and ROS2.How is ROS2 different ‚Äî a summary!1. Third party middlewareROS1 vs ROS2: DDSROS1 has its own middleware which uses a network stack to send information from a node to the right socket, which is received by the middleware again to send information to the right node (over-simplification).ROS2 ditched the middle and now uses Data Distribution Service(DDS), a third-party middleware that is a reliable industry standard.2. No RosmasterRosmaster is a service facilitating two nodes to find each other (if they wish to communicate). This is followed by them connecting to each other directly. If the rosmaster dies during the process, these nodes will still be connected, but no new nodes can join the communication network.In ROS1, each node needs to know the location of the master (even when the system is run on multiple machines).ROS2 did away with the rosmaster, and nodes can find each other directly.3. Shared codebase for Cpp and PythonrclROS has support for two languages, Cpp and Python and the underlying implementation differs in places. For instance, each subscriber has its own thread in Python, but not in Cpp.All that is true for ROS1, but ROS2 has the same shared C implementation. This common codebase is exposed through ROS Client Libraries APIs in C++ and Python.4. Multiple ROS nodes in a processROS1 does not allow multiple ROS nodes in one process. That changes in ROS25. Python build requirementChanging python files in ROS1 doesn‚Äôt require you to build the project. ROS2 needs you to build the project again, which suuuuuuuucks! üò¶6. Action ServicesAction Services weren‚Äôt a part of core ROS1 libraries (but actionlib). ROS2 core libraries have action servers7. Windows supportROS2 is supported by Windows! Well, I sincerely hope you‚Äôre using Linux though üòõ8. Changed launch infrastructureROS1 primarily uses XML-based launch files. ROS2 has a python launch system supporting ordering constraintsWhy move to ROS2?This is a hard question. There is some inertia for the move, mainly because ROS2 community is still not as big as ROS1. This leads to less online development support and longer development time.But most prominent open-source ROS1 packages are or will be at their end of life support soon. Future-proofing projects and upskilling are the two reasons to make the move.ROS2 setupPhase 1: Installing ROS2We are using ubuntu Focal (20.04.3 LTS) in this lesson, which supports ROS2 Galactic.Here‚Äôs alinkthat explains ROS2 installation really well. They do a better job than me to explain installation :)Phase 2: Test ROS2To test our ROS2 setup, we do the following:1.
